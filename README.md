## Usage Drafts

Simple draft demonstrating how this should work.

> Attention, it's a **WIP**! Do not use it yet.

### Main concept

The router is build to work in two modes:
 1. Default - has no tricks
 1. Flow - introduces a flow-based navigation mechanism with interconected
 routes

### Routes & Arguments

Simple route:

````javascript
router.get('/pages', listener);
````

Route with named params:

````javascript
router.get('/pages/:id', listener);
````

Route with splat params:

````javascript
router.get('/pages/:id/tags/*tags', listener);
````

Match-all:

````javascript
router.get('*', listener);
````

Optional params:

````javascript
router.get('/pages/:id?', listener);
router.get('/pages/:id?/tags/*tags?', listener);
````

### Methods

  - `pathname()` - returns current pathname (only works with a middleware)
  - `push(url, title, state)` - changes url emiting events
  - `replace(url, title, state)` - changes url without emiting events

### Default mode

This mode is pretty straightforward, no tricks, just simple routing.

````javascript
var router = new Router;

router.get('/', function(req) {
  console.log('url =', req.url);
  console.log('pattern =', req.pattern);
});

router.get('/pages/:id', function(req) {
  console.log('url =', req.url);
  console.log('pattern =', req.pattern);
  console.log('params =', req.params);
});

router.push('/');

// Will output:
//   url = /
//   pattern = /


router.push('/pages/33');

// Will output:
//   url = /pages/33
//   pattern = /pages/:id
//   params = Object { id: 33 }
````

````javascript
router.get('/pages/:id/tags/*tags?');
````

### Flow mode

Specially built for single page applications with *complex presentation layer*
in mind, in `flow` mode you can connect your routes altogheter, creating a
dependency graph between them.

Lets say you have three routes:

````javascript
router.get('/a', function (req) { /* ... */ });
router.get('/b', function (req) { /* ... */ });
router.get('/c', function (req) { /* ... */ });
````

Now lets assume that `/c` depends on `/b` that depends on `/a`.

So when we call `/c`, we really want to execute:
  1. First `/a`
  1. Then `/b`
  1. And finally `/c`

#### Signature changes

In `flow` mode the `constructor` should receive a transitional mode, tha can be
`destroy+render` or `render+destroy`. This will tell the order that things
should run.

The `.get` method accepts more arguments as well, lets take a look at both.



````javascript
// var router = new Router([flow-mode]);
// var router = new Router('render+destroy');

var router = new Router('destroy+render');
var Pages = new PagesController; // or something

// router.get([pattern], [runner], [destroyer], [dependency]);

router.get('/', Pages.base, Pages.destroy);
router.get('/pages/:id', Pages.show, Pages.destroy, '/');
router.get('/pages/:id/edit', Pages.edit, Pages.destroy, '/pages/:id');
````

Note that now we've passed two listeners among the `.get` call (`runner` and
`destroyer`).

Both will receive two params when called:
- `req` - infos about the request
- `done`- callback to be called when route finishes running or destroying

#### Example

Lets take a look at a full example:

````javascript
var Router = require('ways');

var render = function(req, done) {
  console.log(
    '+ RENDER url=' + req.url +', ' +
    'pattern=' + req.pattern +', ' +
    'params=', req.params
  );
  done();
};

var destroy = function(req, done) {
  console.log(
    '- DESTROY url='+ req.url +', ' +
    'pattern=' + req.pattern +', ' +
    'params=', req.params
  );
  done();
};

var router = new Router('destroy+render');

router.get('/', render, destroy);
router.get('/pages', render, destroy, '/');
router.get('/pages/:id', render, destroy, '/pages');
router.get('/pages/:id/edit', render, destroy, '/pages/:id');
router.get('*', render, destroy);
````

Ok, now lets start our navigation:

##### Step 1

````javascript
router.push('/pages/33/edit');
````

This will produce the following output:

````
+ RENDER url='/', pattern='/', params= Object {}
+ RENDER url='/pages', pattern='/pages', params= Object {}
+ RENDER url='/pages/33', pattern='/pages/:id', params= Object {id: "33"}
+ RENDER url='/pages/33/edit', pattern='/pages/:id/edit', params= Object {id: "33"} 
````
> At the beggining there's no route to be destroyed, so the dependency chain is
> computed and every route gets executed

##### Step 2

````javascript
router.push('/pages/22/edit');
````

This will produce the following output:

````
- DESTROY url='/pages/33/edit', pattern='/pages/:id/edit', params= Object {id: "33"}
- DESTROY url='/pages/33', pattern='/pages/:id', params= Object {id: "33"}
+ RENDER url='/pages/22', pattern='/pages/:id', params= Object {id: "22"}
+ RENDER url='/pages/22/edit', pattern='/pages/:id/edit', params= Object {id: "22"}
````

> Here we have two routes being destroyed before running the new ones, this is computed
> again based on the dependency chain. In this case, uesless routes are `destroyed` before
> running the new ones, this order can be changed passing the mode `destroy+render` to the
> router constructor.

##### Step 3

````javascript
router.push('/any/route/here');
````

This will produce the following output:

````
- DESTROY url='/pages/22/edit', pattern='/pages/:id/edit', params= Object {id: "22"} flow.coffee:10
- DESTROY url='/pages/22', pattern='/pages/:id', params= Object {id: "22"} flow.coffee:10
- DESTROY url='/pages', pattern='/pages', params= Object {} flow.coffee:10
- DESTROY url='/', pattern='/', params= Object {} flow.coffee:10
+ RENDER url='/any/thing/here', pattern='*', params= Object {} 
````

> As the route in question here has no dependencies, note that every other route needs to
> be destroyed before it runs.

# Middlewares

This router alone doesn't implement any HTML5 History or Hash support for use
with browsers, instead there's an API for connecting any middleware your want.

# Usage

````javascript
Router = require('ways');
Middleware = require('ways-browser');

var router = new Router;
router.use(Middleware);

router.get(/* [â€¦] */);
router.push(router.pathname());
````
